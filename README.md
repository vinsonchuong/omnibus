### [Eryn O'Neil: You're the tech lead! Now what?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFK2aJdRucc)
Congratulations! You’re the technical lead on your next project! But now what?
The lead can be responsible for requirements, architecture, communication with
clients or managers, or divvying work amongst the team–and that's just what they
tell you about ahead of time. We’ll talk about how to oversee the project
without losing sight of the day to day, how to motivate your team without
overstepping your bounds, and tactics to deal with issues you might not
anticipate, but will almost certainly encounter.

## Learning Software Development

### [Mozilla: Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
Welcome to the MDN Learning Area. This set of articles aims to provide complete
beginners to web development with all they need to start coding simple websites.

### [Sandi Metz: 99 Bottles of OOP](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/)
"Everybody complains about the weather but nobody does anything about it."
Likewise, everyone has an opinion about what good code looks like, but those
opinions don't help you create it. This book fills that gap. It explains the
process of writing good code, and teaches you to achieve beautifully programmed
ends by way of extremely practical means.

### [Sandi Metz: Get a Whiff of This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjHfa5yxlU)
Most code is a mess. Most new requirements change existing code. Ergo, much our
work involves altering imperfect code.

That's the bad news.

The good news is that every big mess consists of many small ones. Certain small
problems occur so frequently that they've been given names, and are
collectively known as "Code Smells".

This talk shows how to take a pile of perplexing code, identify the "smells",
and surgically apply the curative refactorings. It breaks a messy problem into
clear-cut pieces, and proves that you can fix anything without being forced to
understand everything.

### [Sandi Metz: All the Little Things](https://youtu.be/8bZh5LMaSmE)
Theory tells us to build applications out of small, interchangeable objects but
reality often supplies the exact opposite. Many apps contain huge classes of
long methods and hair-raising conditionals; they're hard to understand,
difficult to reuse and costly to change. This talk takes an ugly section of
conditional code and converts it into a few simple objects. It bridges the gap
between OO theory and practice and teaches straightforward strategies that all
can use to improve their code.

### [Sam Jones: JavaScript Is Too Convenient](https://vimeo.com/267418198)
Which conveniences do we take advantage of everyday? Which are taking advantage
of us?

Objects and functions sure are convenient, so convenient that we do many
shortsighted things just because they’re easy.

In-line objects and anonymous functions create a poor signal to noise ratio,
making it hard to understand your code.

Learn ways to give confusing things names, focus on what’s important, and write
nicer code.

### [Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, Patrick Kua: Building Evolutionary Architectures](https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/building-evolutionary-architectures)
The first principle of evolutionary architecture is to enable incremental change
in an architecture over time. This practical guide gives you everything you need
to know to get started.

### [Eric Elliott: Mocking is a Code Smell](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a)
One of the biggest complaints I hear about TDD and unit tests is that people
struggle with all of the mocking required to isolate units. Some people struggle
to understand how their unit tests are even meaningful. In fact, I’ve seen
developers get so lost in mocks, fakes, and stubs that they wrote entire files
of unit tests where no actual implementation code was exercised at all. Oops.

### [Justin Searls: Please don't mock me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af4M8GMoxi4)
Confusion over test doubles starts with what to even call them. You might know
them as stubs, proxies, mocks, or spies (but I call them test doubles, because a
book you've probably never read declared it to be the most general term). I've
spent a decade fascinated by the disconnect between why test double libraries
were invented and how they are actually used by teams. What I've learned: their
purpose fills a little-known but valuable niche, whereas their appeal addresses
a mainstream but self-destructive impulse. If you don't leave this talk with a
clearer distinction between tests that ensure safe changes versus tests that
promote simple designs, I'll give you your 45 minutes back. Once that groundwork
is laid, you'll better understand the characteristics that matter most in a test
double library and the nuanced rules that should govern their use. I've found
this clarity invaluable for producing valuable tests and maintainable code, and
I think you will too.

### [Gary Bernhardt: Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)
This talk is about using simple values (as opposed to complex objects) not just
for holding data, but also as the boundaries between components and subsystems.
It moves through many topics: functional programming; mutability's relationship
to OO; isolated unit testing with and without test doubles; and concurrency, to
name some.

## CSS

###  [Rachel Andrew: The New CSS Layout](https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout)
CSS Grid Layout will transform the way you design and develop for the web—and I
will change the way you grok the spec. Learn to use Grid Layout within a system
that includes existing methods to perform the tasks they were designed for—and
take advantage of this pivotal moment in the evolution of layout.

###  [Lea Verou: CSS Secrets](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031123.do)
In this practical guide, CSS expert Lea Verou provides 47 undocumented
techniques and tips to help intermediate-to advanced CSS developers devise
elegant solutions to a wide range of everyday web design problems.

Rather than focus on design, CSS Secrets shows you how to solve problems with
code. You'll learn how to apply Lea's analytical approach to practically every
CSS problem you face to attain DRY, maintainable, flexible, lightweight, and
standards-compliant results.
